# common-elements
CommonElements prints out all elements that appear in given two arrays.

Given two arrays of integers, design an algorithm to print out all elements that appear in both lists. 
The output should be in sorted order. Assume the first array has m integers and the second has n 
integers where m is much less than n. Your algorithm should run in n * log m time.

Hint: Sort and binary search.
